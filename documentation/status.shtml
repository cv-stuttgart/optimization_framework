<div class="grline">Explanation</div>
<div  class="textNormal">
<span class="toolname">optimizerOF_TaskServer</span> provides a status page displaying
different important information about the current optimizations. In particular, it 
gives an overview about the clients that evaluate tasks for an optimization process,
their current performance and how the tasks are distributed amongst them.<br><br>
<ul>
 <li>For each client, first of all, the name and IP address of the host computer, its 
     process ID and the number are provided. 
 <li>Then there is a button "STOP Distribution" which is useful to exclude
     the client from further distribution. After having completed the tasks it is currently 
     responsible for, it will not obtain further tasks. This is helpful e.g. in order to 
     restart the client. After the client has been excluded from further distributions, 
     it will be displayed using red fonts and with the annotation "Ignored Host". 
     The exclusion can be revoked by clicking on "Resume Distribution".
 <li>Below (in the red box), there is information about the performance of the client:
   <ul>
     <li>The minimum of all average run times <b>t<sub>avg,min</sub></b>.
     <li>The time since the last acquisition or submission of a task <b>t<sub>busy</sub></b>.
     <li>The minimum of all expected current run times <b>t<sub>eff,min</sub></b> which
         depends on <b>t<sub>avg,min</sub></b> and <b>t<sub>busy</sub></b>.
     <li>The expected current completion time <b>t<sub>finish</sub></b> (maximum over all
         threads).
     <li>The time since the last keep-alive signal of the client <b>t<sub>silence</sub></b>
         that is sent periodically in order to indicate that the client is still running.
     <li>For each optimization (indicated by the <em>optimization ID</em>), its average
         run time <b>t<sub>avg</sub></b> is displayed.
   </ul>
 <li>For each thread, a list of assigned tasks accompagnied by the (remaining) expected 
     run time is provided. The first task is red if it is currently computed by the client.
     At the beginning of each row, the start time of the first task <em>A</em>, 
     the expected completion time of all assigned tasks <em>B</em> and the total expected 
     computation time <em>C</em> are given in the form <b>(A - B - C):".
</ul>
